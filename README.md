# Datasets
Benchmark datasets for WGS analysis of SARS-CoV-2.

## Purpose
Technical Outreach and Assistance for States Team (TOAST) developed benchmark datasets for SARS-CoV-2 sequencing which are designed to help users at varying stages of building sequencing capacity. It consists of six datasets summarized in the table below, each chosen to represent a different use case.

## Installation & Usage

### Other installation methods

Some methods of installation are maintained by the community.
Although we do not have direct control over them, we would like to list them for convenience.

Visit [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for these methods.

### From Source Code

Grab the latest stable release under the releases tab.  If you are feeling adventurous, use `git clone`!  Include the scripts directory in your path.  For example, if you downloaded this project into your local bin directory:

    $ export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin/datasets/scripts

Additionally, ensure that you have the [NCBI API key](https://ncbiinsights.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2017/11/02/new-api-keys-for-the-e-utilities).
This key associates your edirect requests with your username.
Without it, edirect requests might be buggy.
After obtaining an NCBI API key, add it to your environment with

    export NCBI_API_KEY=unique_api_key_goes_here

where `unique_api_key_goes_here` is a unique hexadecimal number with characters from 0-9 and a-f.
You should also set your email address in the
`EMAIL` environment variable as edirect tries to guess it, which is an error prone process.
Add this variable to your environment with

    export EMAIL=my@email.address

using your own email address instead of `my@email.address`.

#### Dependencies

In addition to the installation above, please install the following.

1. edirect (see section on edirect below)
2. sra-toolkit, built from source: https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools/wiki/Building-and-Installing-from-Source
3. Perl 5.12.0
4. Make
5. wget - Brew users: `brew install wget`
6. sha256sum - Linux-based OSs should have this already; Other users should see the relevant installation section below.

#### Installing edirect

Modified instructions from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK179288/

    sh -c "$(curl -fsSL ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/entrezdirect/install-edirect.sh)"

**NOTE**: edirect needs an NCBI API key.
Instructions can be found at https://ncbiinsights.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2017/11/02/new-api-keys-for-the-e-utilities

#### Installing sha256sum

If you do not have sha256sum (e.g., if you are on MacOS), then try to make the shell function and export it.

    function sha256sum() { shasum -a 256 "$@" ; }
    export -f sha256sum

This shell function will need to be defined in the current session. To make it permanent for future sessions, add it to `$HOME/.bashrc`.

## Downloading a dataset
To run, you need a dataset in tsv format.  Here is the usage statement:

    Usage: GenFSGopher.pl -o outdir spreadsheet.dataset.tsv
    PARAM        DEFAULT  DESCRIPTION
    --outdir     <req'd>  The output directory
    --compressed          Compress files after finishing hashsum verification
    --format     tsv      The input format. Default: tsv. No other format
                          is accepted at this time.
    --layout     onedir   onedir   - Everything goes into one directory
                          byrun    - Each genome run gets its separate directory
                          byformat - Fastq files to one dir, assembly to another, etc
                          cfsan    - Reference and samples in separate directories with
                                     each sample in a separate subdirectory
    --shuffled   <NONE>   Output the reads as interleaved instead of individual
                          forward and reverse files.
    --norun      <NONE>   Do not run anything; just create a Makefile.
    --numcpus    1        How many jobs to run at once. Be careful of disk I/O.
    --citation            Print the recommended citation for this script and exit
    --version             Print the version and exit
    --help                Print the usage statement and die

## Using a dataset

There is a field `intendedUse` which suggests how a particular dataset might be used.  For example, Epi-validated outbreak datasets might be used with a SNP-based or MLST-based workflow.  As the number of different values for `intendedUse` increases, other use-cases will be available.  Otherwise, how you use a dataset is up to you!

## Creating your own dataset
To create your own dataset and to make it compatible with the existing script(s) here, please follow these instructions.  These instructions are subject to change.

Start by creating a new Excel spreadsheet with only one tab. Please delete any extraneous tabs to avoid confusion.
Then view the [specification](SPECIFICATION.md).
